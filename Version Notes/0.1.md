## Version notes for Version 0.1

This is the initial version of SeaLegs. Currently, ECS classes haven't been written and implemented. However, SeaLegs handles a lot of boilerplate code necessary to begin creating browser games using Blazor WASM with the BECanvas extension.

## Razor Pages
### SLDisplay.razor and SLDisplayComponent.cs
The SLDisplay razor page and SLDisplayComponent both handle a massive chunk of boilerplate code so that devs can connect their game logic to the SeaLegs library for rendering. The razor page itself is set-up in a way so that simply including <SLDisplay> in any razor page will display the canvas as it's set-up. This includes several parameters for initialization of the canvas, including aspect ratio via AspectRatioWidth and AspectRatioHeight, as well as Width and Height for anyone who wants to use definite canvas dimensions.

The SLDisplayComponent class connects all of the HTML elements such as the canvas and div wrapper to the SeaLegs library in order to quickly retrieve the context, JS Interop module, as well as keyboard and mouse input. I've also included functionality for canvas resizing when building the canvas using aspect ratios, so that the canvas will scale with the browser screen size but maintain it's aspect ratio.

### Graphics.razor
This razor page handles taking image file paths passed into the data structure and creating the needed <img> elements for the game. The elements are then stored in a dictionary with the path as the key and the ElementReference as the value for easy retrieval in game logic. ElementReferences for sprites and entitities need to be retrieved from the GraphicsData class.

## Controllers
### Controllers
This is the bread and butter of the boilerplate code. These classes act as connectors between any game, or even canvas application, and the HTML elements of the SLDisplay razor pages.

### CanvasController
This controller stores data for the canvas, context, JS interop module, and dimensions and scaling data for the canvas itself. It also holds the first Update() method called from the thread created to run the game (Currently set to 60 FPS).

### InputController
Receives keyboard presses and mouse input from the browser, including mouse position and button press coordinates. This data can also be retrieved from within the game logic by checking if a key has been pressed via InputController.IsKeyPressed(key) and InputController.OnMouseDown().

### RenderingController
Handles all of the rendering to the canvas in a simplified way. Each method matches the DrawImageAsync() function built into BECanvas and can be accessed through RenderingController.Draw(). There is one additional overload I created on top of the BECanvas rendering, which handles rotation as well. The rendering controller is set-up to handle scaling with the canvas size.

### Audio Controller
Connects the game to JSInterop for playing sounds, including looping audio for music. Also includes functionality to stop a looping audio file (such as background music) and change the master volume of the game.

## Data Structure
### Game Settings
This class currently doesn't do much but stores the base dimensions for the game. These dimensions are used when calculating the scale of in-game assets.

### Graphics Data
This class holds the list of all image file paths used for initializing images for the project when started, plus storing the ElementReference objects for each image so that the graphics can be rendered on screen. In order to retrieve a ElementReference for a sprite or entity within game, use GraphicsData.FindSprite(path) and the ElementReference will be returned from the dictionary.
