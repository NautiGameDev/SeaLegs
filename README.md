# SeaLegs V0.1
SeaLegs is a library and Entity Component System designed to streamline game development in Blazor Webassembly. As of now, May 6, 2025, SeaLegs is a folder that can be placed in the project solution of a stand-alone Blazor Web Application. The goal is to eventually release this as a NuGet package, however, at the time of writing this there is still a lot of work to do.

At the moment this library is built upon the Blazor.Extensions.Canvas NuGet package, or BECanvas. More information about this extension can be found [here](https://github.com/BlazorExtensions/Canvas) and must be set-up appropriately before using the SeaLegs library. In the far future I plan on writing my own API for rendering graphics to the HTML Canvas element, with both 2Dcontext and WebGL support, but as this project is still in the early stages of the development cycle I'm building upon BECanvas to save some time.

## How to use
This section will be built upon over time during the development process. The instructions here are for functionality currently available in the library.
